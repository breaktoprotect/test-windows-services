Summarized evidence collected:
CLIUSR

Groups: only in Users.

Logon rights:

SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight

SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight
‚Üí explicitly non-interactive.

Cluster binding: not needed, but we know it‚Äôs the default documented identity.

Password: cluster-managed, no human knowledge.

Conclusion: CLIUSR is a pure service identity, zero risk of manual login. Exempt from SOX ALM.

CLMUSR

Groups: in Users and Hyper-V Administrators.

Logon rights:

No explicit deny rights found.

Not granted interactive rights either ‚Äî just not denied.

Password: cluster-managed, unknown to any admin. runas fails (password inaccessible).

Cluster binding: not directly referenced in resource parameters, but provisioned automatically with cluster.

Conclusion:

Technically capable of interactivity (no deny entries in SecPol).

Practically blocked because:

Password is generated and controlled by cluster service.

No admin ever has access to it.

Membership in Hyper-V Administrators is the real concern ‚Äî gives it elevated platform-level control if somehow compromised.

üîí ALM / Cybersecurity Posture

CLIUSR ‚Üí
Treat as exempt: OS-managed service identity, non-interactive by policy.
Covered by SOC monitoring for abnormal events.

CLMUSR ‚Üí
Options for your firm:

Exempt (with justification):

‚ÄúCluster-provisioned local service identity, password not human-accessible, no interactive use possible.‚Äù

SOC continues to monitor.

In-scope for ALM:

Because of membership in Hyper-V Administrators and lack of deny logon rights, a strict auditor may demand ALM coverage.

----------
Risk Position Paper: Cluster Service Accounts (CLIUSR and CLMUSR) in Windows Server 2025
1. Background

As part of SOX Access Lifecycle Management (ALM) review, we investigated the existence and behavior of two accounts created by Windows Server 2025 Failover Clustering:

CLIUSR (documented by Microsoft)

CLMUSR (undocumented, observed in lab testing)

The goal was to determine whether these accounts require ALM onboarding or may be treated as exempt service identities.

2. Investigation Findings
CLIUSR

Provisioning: Auto-created when a node joins a cluster.

Group Membership: Limited to Users.

Logon Rights: Explicitly denied local and remote interactive logon (SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight, SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight).

Password Management: Cluster-generated and inaccessible to administrators.

Usage: Bound exclusively to cluster service authentication.

Assessment: CLIUSR is a non-interactive service account. Risk of misuse is minimal.

CLMUSR

Provisioning: Auto-created alongside CLIUSR when a cluster is formed.

Group Membership: Member of Users and Hyper-V Administrators.

Logon Rights: No deny logon restrictions set.

Password Management: Cluster-generated and inaccessible to administrators (runas confirms password is not obtainable).

Usage: Not referenced in cluster resource parameters but logged on at cluster creation, indicating backend service use.

Assessment: CLMUSR has elevated rights (via Hyper-V Administrators) and lacks explicit deny-interactive policy. Although its password is cluster-managed and effectively blocks direct human login, its privilege level introduces potential risk if compromised.

3. Risk-Based Analysis

CLIUSR: Safe to exempt from SOX ALM. Functionally equivalent to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or Local Service. Covered by SOC monitoring.

CLMUSR: Riskier due to group membership and absence of deny logon restrictions. In practice, still non-usable interactively because credentials are not known. Risk lies in hypothetical OS/service compromise where CLMUSR token could be hijacked.

4. Recommended Next Steps

CLIUSR

Document as cluster service identity.

Mark exempt from ALM, continue SOC anomaly monitoring.

CLMUSR

Two possible risk positions:

Conservative (Strict ALM): Bring CLMUSR under ALM scope due to elevated privileges.

Practical (Risk-Justified Exemption): Exempt with justification: password inaccessible, OS-managed, service-only usage, covered by SOC detection.

Action: Escalate to governance body (e.g., SOX controls committee) for a decision on ALM treatment.

5. Conclusion

CLIUSR: Low risk, service-only ‚Üí Exempt from ALM.

CLMUSR: Medium risk due to privileges but still effectively service-only. Requires formal risk acceptance if exempted.

This position allows compliance and operations teams to align on whether CLMUSR should be handled as an exceptional service account (with compensating SOC controls) or included in full ALM.
