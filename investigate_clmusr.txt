Summarized evidence collected:
CLIUSR

Groups: only in Users.

Logon rights:

SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight

SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight
‚Üí explicitly non-interactive.

Cluster binding: not needed, but we know it‚Äôs the default documented identity.

Password: cluster-managed, no human knowledge.

Conclusion: CLIUSR is a pure service identity, zero risk of manual login. Exempt from SOX ALM.

CLMUSR

Groups: in Users and Hyper-V Administrators.

Logon rights:

No explicit deny rights found.

Not granted interactive rights either ‚Äî just not denied.

Password: cluster-managed, unknown to any admin. runas fails (password inaccessible).

Cluster binding: not directly referenced in resource parameters, but provisioned automatically with cluster.

Conclusion:

Technically capable of interactivity (no deny entries in SecPol).

Practically blocked because:

Password is generated and controlled by cluster service.

No admin ever has access to it.

Membership in Hyper-V Administrators is the real concern ‚Äî gives it elevated platform-level control if somehow compromised.

üîí ALM / Cybersecurity Posture

CLIUSR ‚Üí
Treat as exempt: OS-managed service identity, non-interactive by policy.
Covered by SOC monitoring for abnormal events.

CLMUSR ‚Üí
Options for your firm:

Exempt (with justification):

‚ÄúCluster-provisioned local service identity, password not human-accessible, no interactive use possible.‚Äù

SOC continues to monitor.

In-scope for ALM:

Because of membership in Hyper-V Administrators and lack of deny logon rights, a strict auditor may demand ALM coverage.

----------
Risk Position Paper: Cluster Service Accounts (CLIUSR and CLMUSR) in Windows Server 2025
1. Background

As part of a security governance review, we investigated the existence and behavior of two accounts created by Windows Server 2025 Failover Clustering:

CLIUSR (documented by Microsoft)

CLMUSR (undocumented, observed in lab testing)

The goal was to determine whether these accounts should be treated as exempt system identities or require additional governance controls.

2. Investigation Findings
CLIUSR

Provisioning: Auto-created when a node joins a cluster.

Group Membership: Limited to Users.

Logon Rights: Explicitly denied local and remote interactive logon (SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight, SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight).

Password Management: Cluster-generated and inaccessible to administrators.

Usage: Bound exclusively to cluster service authentication.

Assessment: CLIUSR is a non-interactive service account. Risk of misuse is minimal.

CLMUSR

Provisioning: Auto-created alongside CLIUSR when a cluster is formed.

Group Membership: Member of Users and Hyper-V Administrators.

Logon Rights:

No explicit deny logon restrictions.

Because it is in Users, it inherits interactive console logon rights (SeInteractiveLogonRight).

Remote logon (SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight) is not granted, as CLMUSR is not in Remote Desktop Users.

Password Management: Cluster-generated and inaccessible to administrators (runas fails, password is system-controlled).

Usage: Not referenced in cluster resource parameters but logged on at cluster creation, indicating backend service use.

Assessment: CLMUSR has elevated rights (via Hyper-V Administrators) and retains theoretical interactive capability due to inherited logon rights. In practice, it is blocked because the password is never disclosed, but the combination of logon capability + elevated group membership increases residual risk.

3. Risk-Based Analysis

CLIUSR
Safe to treat as an exempt system service identity. Functionally equivalent to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or Local Service. Covered by monitoring for abnormal use.

CLMUSR

Risk Factors:

Member of Hyper-V Administrators (sensitive platform control).

Inherits SeInteractiveLogonRight via Users group, unlike CLIUSR which is explicitly denied.

No known password exposure mitigates interactive misuse, but credential theft/token hijacking scenarios remain possible.

Residual Risk: Medium. While practically non-usable interactively, its technical privileges and rights inheritance justify stronger scrutiny.

4. Recommended Next Steps
CLIUSR

Document as a system-managed cluster service identity.

Mark as governance-exempt, continue SOC monitoring for abnormal use.

CLMUSR

Two possible governance positions:

Conservative (Strict Governance): Apply additional controls due to inherited logon rights and elevated group membership.

Practical (Risk-Justified Exemption): Exempt with justification:

Password inaccessible to admins.

OS-managed, created and removed with cluster lifecycle.

No interactive use possible without credential compromise.

Covered by SOC monitoring.

Action: Escalate to governance/risk committee for decision on how to classify CLMUSR.

5. Conclusion

CLIUSR: Low risk, service-only ‚Üí Exempt from governance controls.

CLMUSR: Medium risk due to Hyper-V Administrators membership and inherited interactive logon rights. Effectively service-only, but requires formal governance decision if exempted.

This position allows security governance stakeholders to align on whether CLMUSR should be handled as an exceptional system account (with compensating SOC monitoring) or require stricter governance controls.
